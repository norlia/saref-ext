<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology extends the SAREF ontology for the Smart Cities domain. This work has been developed in the context of the STF 534 (https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STFHomePages/STF534.aspx), which was established with the goal to create three SAREF extensions, one of them for the Smart Cities domain.</span>
